# =============================================================================
# Semantic Release Workflow
# =============================================================================
#
# Automatically creates releases based on conventional commits.
# Runs after successful deployment to main.
#
# What it does:
#   1. Analyzes commits since last release
#   2. Determines next version (major/minor/patch)
#   3. Generates CHANGELOG.md
#   4. Creates GitHub Release with notes
#   5. Commits version bump back to repo
#
# Commit types that trigger releases:
#   - feat: → minor version bump (1.0.0 → 1.1.0)
#   - fix:  → patch version bump (1.0.0 → 1.0.1)
#   - perf: → patch version bump
#   - BREAKING CHANGE → major version bump (1.0.0 → 2.0.0)
#
# Required secrets:
#   - GITHUB_TOKEN (automatically provided)
#
