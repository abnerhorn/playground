# Coding Rules

> **What is this file?**
> This file tells Cursor AI how to write code in your project.
> It enforces consistent patterns and catches common mistakes.
> Update this file when you establish new conventions.

## Code Style

### TypeScript
- Use strict mode
- Prefer explicit types over `any`
- Use path aliases: `@/lib/*`, `@/components/*`, `@/app/*`

### React/Next.js
- Use Server Components by default
- Add `'use client'` only when hooks/interactivity are needed
- Use `useCallback` and `useMemo` for performance in client components
- Prefer async Server Components for data fetching

### Components
- Functional components only
- Props interfaces defined inline or in same file
- Use `cn()` utility from `@/lib/utils/cn` for conditional classes
- Check `components/ui/` (shadcn) before creating new UI components

### Styling
- Use Tailwind CSS exclusively
- Dark mode: Use `dark:` prefix
- Use custom typography scale: `text-title`, `text-body`, `text-section`
- Use `can-hover:` variant for navigation links (prevents iOS sticky hover)

## Centralized Configs

| Need | Location |
|------|----------|
| Site content | `lib/site-config.ts` |
| Shared styles | `lib/styles.ts` |
| Keyboard shortcuts | `lib/keyboard/shortcuts.ts` |
| SVG icons | `components/Icons.tsx` |

## API Routes
- Return JSON responses
- Use `withSession()` or `withAdmin()` HOC from `@/lib/auth`
- Use proper HTTP status codes (401, 403, 404, 400)

## Database
- Use singleton Prisma client from `@/lib/db`
- Keep queries in Server Components or API routes
- Handle edge cases (not found, already exists)

## Touch/Mobile
- Use `TapLink` for nav links (iOS scroll detection)
- Add `overscroll-contain` to scrollable containers
- Support `prefers-reduced-motion`

## Don't
- Don't use inline styles
- Don't put business logic in components (use lib/)
- Don't commit `.env.local` files
- Don't use raw Tailwind font sizes (`text-sm`, `text-lg`)
- Don't duplicate values — abstract them
- Don't create UI components when shadcn has one

## Do
- Keep components small and focused
- Use semantic HTML
- Handle loading and error states
- Check existing abstractions before creating new ones
- Add explainer comments to new files

## Git Workflow

**Trigger rules:**
- `d`, `g`, or `p` typed **alone** (single character message) → Execute immediately
- Mentioned in a sentence → Do NOT execute, just discuss

### "d" — Dev commit
1. If not on `dev`: create/switch to `dev` branch
2. `git add -A && git status -sb && git diff --staged --stat`
3. Review changes with user
4. Commit with descriptive message
5. Push to `dev` branch (set upstream if needed: `git push -u origin dev`)

### "g" — Production commit
1. `git add -A && git status -sb && git diff --staged --stat`
2. Review changes with user
3. Commit with descriptive message
4. If on `dev`: merge to `main`, push `main`, return to `dev`
5. If on `main`: push `main`, stay on `main`

### "p" — Pull with stash
1. Stash only if there are uncommitted changes
2. `git pull --rebase`
3. Pop stash only if one was created

## Planning Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `plans/Tomorrow.md` | Immediate tasks |
| `plans/Future.md` | Long-term ideas |
| `plans/tmp/` | Working drafts (gitignored) |

Use checkboxes in Tomorrow.md. Move completed items to Future.md or delete.
